#folder and python file are also objects and we cannot use the capital letters in the starting of file name and space is not allowed in the name

#Identifier---
#Name of an any object in python are called identifier.

#Rules===========

#1. Do not start with digit.
#1X=10 displays error.


#2. start with letters and underscore(_)

x=10
X=20
_x=25
print(x, X, _x)


#3. case sensitive declaration should be properly named while calling. 
name= "Harshal Thakre"
print(name)
#print(Name) Error case sensitive
 

#space not allowed in declarations. so we will use underscore instead of space.

#combinations are allowed but follow the above two rules
_abcd1e=50

#space defines the block so it is not allowed.

#identifier is the name of the object and variable is the container in which we store or holds values and data.
